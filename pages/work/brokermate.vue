        <p>
          Brokermate is a financial technology platform, that provides all the
          tools required to run a successful brokerage. Until now, brokers have
          had to rely on several different technologies to manage their
          business. Brokermate eliminates these layers and brings together
          everything you need in one solution.

        <h4>Challenge</h4>

        <p>
          While developing a highly complex brokerage management and client
          interaction application, Brokermate discovered that new users needed a
          way to quickly get started using the service.

        <h4>Solution</h4>

        <p>
          Integrating the Shepherd site tour library, we were able to manage
          multiple visual guides for first time users to add required settings
          and communicate to them how the applications functioned. This was done
          in a way that lead new users to a home setup page, then tracked each
          tour state to ensure completion.

          We leveraged the existing

          libraries, and added additional features to them, to allow us to fully
          customize many steps, and accommodate design requirements. The site
          tour we created helped walk the users through several different app
          features, and illustrated the location of these features, in the app
          they are currently using. We also added step tracking, throughout the
          app, to ensure that users completed certain steps, such as changing
          pages or adding account settings, before transitioning to subsequent
          tour steps.

          Finally, we needed the tours to integrate into application features,
          such as translations and transition animations, so that they felt like
          an integrated part of the application, as opposed to an add-on.

        <h4>Outcome</h4>

        <p>
          New users are now shown a list of tours, to help add required
          configurations and quickly get them familiar with the application. The
          user is scoped to either completing the action asked in the step or
          canceling a tour, in order to return later.
        </p>

        <p>
          They begin tours with customized tour themes that integrate naturally
          into the application flow. All features for this global application
          were applied to the tour initialization allowing for international,
          routable, and trackable tours.
