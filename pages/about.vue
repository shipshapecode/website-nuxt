                  Started developing in Ember back in 2012 while working for a
                  startup, Mail Pilot. Specialties: Ember.js, Nuxt.js,
                  JavaScript

                  I worked at several Ember companies like RSA, and started
                  working on the side doing Ember consulting. Eventually, I
                  decided to transition full-time and created Ship Shape.

                  At a time when the lines between web development and design
                  were heavily blurred, I learned to create sites buried in HTML
                  tables for layout and images cut up in Adobe Photoshop. As
                  those standards evolved, I’ve built experiences and
                  applications solving issues from media delivery, marketing
                  analytics, and entire business process management.

                  Building the completely redesigned Jebbit MVP for their
                  campaign flow. Jebbit had an extremely complex system for
                  creating campaigns and after a lot of research with their
                  customers, an entirely simplified experience has been created
                  to allow for detailed configuration and true ease to get from
                  start to live campaign quickly.
