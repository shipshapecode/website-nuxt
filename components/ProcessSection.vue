              We use the latest versions of Ember.js and Ember-CLI in all of our projects,
              and leverage the amazing <a href="/ember-consulting/">Ember community</a>, and its huge breadth of
              <a href="/open-source/">addons</a> to help us iterate faster, and focus on making quality apps,
              instead of reinventing the wheel.
