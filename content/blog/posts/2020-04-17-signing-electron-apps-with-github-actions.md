---

We've been working hard over the past many months, at Ship Shape, on a cross platform
menubar color management app called [Swach](https://swach.io), and as part of that work, 
we had a need to sign our app for both MacOS and Windows. There are many existing articles 
on doing this with [Travis](https://www.update.rocks/blog/osx-signing-with-travis/) or 
[Appveyor](https://www.update.rocks/blog/windows-signing-for-your-electron-app-with-appveyor-ci/), 
but the documentation for using GitHub actions is lacking, so we wanted to quickly share what 
we learned.

## MacOS

### Getting your certificate from Apple

You will need an Apple developer account to generate a certificate. You can sign up at 
[https://developer.apple.com/programs/](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).

Once you have a developer account, you can go to your account and click 
`Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles` to manage your certificates. Click the plus button
to add a new certificate.

At the time of writing, there are 9 types of certificates, but we are only interested in two.
You will want to generate both the `Developer ID Installer`, and `Developer ID Application`
certificates, as both are needed to sign the application and installer for distribution 
*outside* the app store.

### Adding your certificate to GitHub

Once you have your certificates from Apple, you'll want to export them as a `.p12`, which
we will then copy the contents of to save to GitHub as a secret.

```bash
base64 -w 0 path/to/your/certificate.p12
```

You will then want to copy your certificate output into a secret named `CERTIFICATE_OSX_APPLICATION`,
as well as the password you set for the certificate to `CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`.

![The GitHub settings page showing a list of secrets.](/img/blog/electron/github-secrets.jpg)

Once the secrets are added, we need to write a script to get them into our keychain.

**add-osx-cert.sh**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

KEY_CHAIN=build.keychain
CERTIFICATE_P12=certificate.p12

# Recreate the certificate from the secure environment variable
echo $CERTIFICATE_OSX_APPLICATION | base64 --decode > $CERTIFICATE_P12

#create a keychain
security create-keychain -p actions $KEY_CHAIN

# Make the keychain the default so identities are found
security default-keychain -s $KEY_CHAIN

# Unlock the keychain
security unlock-keychain -p actions $KEY_CHAIN

security import $CERTIFICATE_P12 -k $KEY_CHAIN -P $CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD -T /usr/bin/codesign;

security set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple: -s -k actions $KEY_CHAIN

# remove certs
rm -fr *.p12
```

### Calling the script in GitHub actions

You'll want to create a step in your actions something like this:

```yml
- name: Add MacOS certs
  if: matrix.os == 'macos-latest' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  run: chmod +x add-osx-cert.sh && ./add-osx-cert.sh
  env:
    CERTIFICATE_OSX_APPLICATION: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_OSX_APPLICATION }}
    CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD }}
```

This will call the scripts when you are running on `macos-latest` and add the
certs as env variables.

### Notarizing your MacOS app

Apple now requires notarizing your MacOS apps as well. We use 
[electron-forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) for building our apps,
which allows for notarizing as well, and our config looks like this:

```js
packagerConfig: {
  asar: true,
  darwinDarkModeSupport: 'true',
  icon: 'electron-app/resources/icon',
  name: 'Your app name',
  osxSign: {
    entitlements: 'electron-app/src/entitlements.plist',
    'entitlements-inherit': 'electron-app/src/entitlements.plist',
    'gatekeeper-assess': false,
    hardenedRuntime: true,
    identity: 'Developer ID Application: YOUR NAME HERE (YOUR ID HERE)'
  },
  osxNotarize: {
    appleId: process.env['APPLE_ID'],
    appleIdPassword: process.env['APPLE_ID_PASSWORD']
  },
  packageManager: 'yarn'
},
```

You'll notice the `osxNotarize` section which essentially just requires you to set more 
GitHub secrets containing your `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD` to be used for notarizing.

### Entitlements and other settings

We found that additional configuration was needed to get our application running as more than
just a blank screen. We needed `entitlements`, as well as `hardenedRuntime` and `gatekeeper-assess`,
but these settings will vary depending on your app. The `entitlements.plist` that we are using is:

**entitlements.plist**

```plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-executable-page-protection</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.automation.apple-events</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

That should be all you need for MacOS signing and notarizing via GitHub actions,
but please let us know if you encountered any issues!

## Windows

As with MacOS, Windows applications must also be signed, however Microsoft does not
handle certificates in house, so you will need to get a third party certificate to use
for signing. We got our certificate from 
[GoDaddy](https://au.godaddy.com/web-security/code-signing-certificate), but see 
[here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/code-signing#signing-windows-builds)
for some alternative choices.

Once you get your certificate file, you'll need to output it to `.pfx` and then we will copy
the output of that into a GitHub secret called `CERTIFICATE_WINDOWS_PFX`.

```shell
base64.exe -w 0 <your-certificate-name>.pfx
```

We will also need to add the password for the cert as a `WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD` GitHub secret.

We'll then add a step to our GitHub actions of the following:

```yml
- name: Add Windows certificate
        if: matrix.os == 'windows-latest' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        id: write_file
        uses: timheuer/base64-to-file@v1
        with:
          fileName: 'win-certificate.pfx'
          encodedString: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_WINDOWS_PFX }}
```

This will copy the base64 output to a file to be used by the Windows signing process.

Electron Forge allows you to specify the Windows certificate file and password in the config for
the Windows Squirrel maker, so once the file has been created you should just need to add the
following to your `config.forge.js`.

```js
makers: [
  {
    name: '@electron-forge/maker-squirrel',
    config: {
      name: 'Your app name',
      certificateFile: process.env['WINDOWS_PFX_FILE'],
      certificatePassword: process.env['WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD']
    }
  }
]  
```

That should be all the setup necessary to get your Windows certificates up and running!

## Building the application

Once your certificates are all setup, you should be ready to build your application.
For completeness, here is our entire workflow file for GitHub actions, which includes
adding all the certs, signing, and building the project.

It will only run tests unless a new tag is pushed. When a new tag is pushed, it will
build on MacOS, Windows, and Ubuntu, and push all of those release assets to GitHub.

```yml
name: Package and Release

  pull_request: {}
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    tags:
      - v*

    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    needs: test
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Use node 12.x

        run: chmod +x add-osx-cert.sh && ./add-osx-cert.sh
        env:
          CERTIFICATE_OSX_APPLICATION: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_OSX_APPLICATION }}
          CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD }}
      - name: Add Windows certificate

        with:
          fileName: 'win-certificate.pfx'
          encodedString: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_WINDOWS_PFX }}
      # - name: Setup flatpak
      #   if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
      #   run: sudo apt install flatpak flatpak-builder elfutils
      - name: Make
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        run: yarn make
        env:
          APPLE_ID: ${{ secrets.APPLE_ID }}
          APPLE_ID_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.APPLE_ID_PASSWORD }}
          WINDOWS_PFX_FILE: ${{ steps.write_file.outputs.filePath }}
          WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.WINDOWS_PFX_PASSWORD }}
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          files: |
            electron-app/out/**/*.deb
            electron-app/out/**/*.dmg
            electron-app/out/**/*Setup.exe
            electron-app/out/**/*.rpm
            electron-app/out/**/*.zip
```

Some of this is specific to our needs for Swach, and specific to both ember-electron and 
electron-forge usage, but most of it is generally applicable to any Electron app builds,
so hopefully you can tweak it to work with whatever your setup may be!
