# What To Consider Before Your First Digital Nomad Trip

The needs of a digital nomad are different than those of travelers who are not working as they visit different places or people who are on vacation for a considerably shorter period of time. There are number of logistical and lifestyle considerations that need to be thought about prior to making a first trip as a digital nomad.

## Safety
You should definitely take a look at the statistics on safety for the location you're considering visiting. A lot of people like to paint certain areas with a wide brush, cautioning how unsafe a particular destination might be, when that might not be the case. Take a look at data for the country as a whole, but also the city you are interested in visiting. You should nvestigate if certain neighborhoods are considered safer than others, if you should take extra precautions walking around at night, and if travelers are suggested to try to conceal their valuables. 

## Internet Access
Some locations have better internet than others, and you'll want to look into Internet reliability and speeds before traveling to a location since it's crucial for getting your work done. Another thing to keep in mind is that some regions of the world have a real threat of blackouts which either occur routinely or may occur has a result of political unrest. Do your research ahead of time in order to prepare, you may decide to avoid a location if tit seems like Internet availability in a given location might not meet your needs. 

Wherever you travel, it is a good idea to try to get a SIM card with data so that you can use it in a pinch, whether you are on the go and there is no wi-fi available, or if the wi-fi you have been using suddenly becomes less reliable. 


## Timing of your Trip


### Travel Pace 

Even if you do give up your current residence and fully commit to digital nomading, you should keep in mind that when you start digital nomading, you shouldn't be embarking on a period of constant moving week-to-week for a period of months. I moved frequently when I first started nomading but eventually realized that I needed to go much slower in order to manage getting familiar with a new place, having time to see attractions near me, getting my work done, and planning the logistics of getting to my next destinations. I would personally recommend staying in most places you visit for a minimum of three weeks, especially when just starting out, in order for you to adapt to your new lifestyle and have time to get your bearings. 

Some first time nomads are excited about the idea of going away from their home country for months at a time. This can definitely be invigorating, but months of the road can also be exhausting and could lead to burn out. You might want not want to plan on being gone for a full year the first time you nomad.

### When You'll Travel
 If you go to a location in the winter, you'll have less daylight and won't get to see as much before it gets dark.
 On the other hand, many locations that experience four seasons tend to have an increase of tourists during the warmer seasons -- traveling in the winter could mean lower costs and less crowds. 

### Time Zones
The time zone of the location you are working is a huge consideration. Some nomads prefer working in the same or very similar time zones to where their other colleagues are based. Others don't mind working further and making moderate to relatively large adjustments in their sleep cycle and structure of their day. 


## Lifestyle

### Cost of Living
I would recommend giving some thought to what kind of lifestyle you'll want to live while abroad. A major factor in how you'll live while abroad is the cost of living. When a plan a trip a lower cost of living is often a draw for me. Although I don't entirely avoid higher cost of living locations, I definitely stay there for less time than I do less expensive locations. When planning a trip you should take a look at the cost of living for the specific cities or towns you're curious about and pay attention for average prices for food and lodging in particular.  


### Your Accomodation and Workplace
I would definitely recommend finding out where the more central neighborhoods are where you're staying and trying to stay in one of those if available and there aren't any safety concerns that could be allevitated by staying elsewhere. This generally costs a bit more, but allow you to make more of the time you have there. Staying somewhere that is a bit further out, but well connected by public transit is also something to consider, especially you're going to be staying awhile. I really prefer to rent an apartment and often work from there, but I don't think everyone should necessarily do that -- many nomads really enjoy both living in and working in shared accomodations.

Some hostels or more communal accomodations do have quieter common areas with desk space where you could work if that's an option that is interesting to you. As an example, I once stayed at Cityhub in Copenhagen and was able to get work done in the shared area near the kitchen with no problem. Additionally, if you have a different working preference than me and really prefer to get out of the house, you can try to look into local options such as cafes. If you think you may want to often do work at cafes, try to find out ahead of time if outlets are available. Another option, especially common in digital nomad hubs, is to work at local co-working places. This will allow you to have space to work and also meet other people who are working while traveling as well. 

### Ease of Travel To Other Locations
Is this destination easy to get to? Are you going to want easy access to others? Certain areas, like many parts of Europe, have a myriad of relatively low-cost and frequent connections to nearby places of interest. Other areas of the world are expensive to get to and may not have many transit options. Before choosing a destination, consider if you want to visit others on this trip.

#### How much convenience you want
In Japan, it’s very easy to get an assortment of items very easily and for competitive prices. If something’s not available, you can order online and often pick it up at the convenience store a few days later. 


#### Entry and Exit Requirements
Before you a book a ticket, make sure you understand the entry and exit requirements for that country. Some countries may require visitors from certain countries to get a visa, while others are different countries can enter visa free. The process for visas varies widely by country. Some countries will allow you to pay for the visa ahead of time and issue you one in a matter of days, or if you pay for an expedited one, hours. Others may require you to travel to a regional consulate that might not be particular close to where you reside to apply for the visa, and then you might have to return on a different day to pick up the visa. You may be required to show certain paperwork, like your boarding pass, when entering a country. Looking into this is very important so that you don't miss out on your trip. 

When leaving a country, you may need to show your visa, so make sure you keep it in a safe place. If you want to travel to other countries, you might also want to take a look at those entry requirements as well. For instance, if you were visiting Thailand and interested in visiting some neighboring countries like Vietnam, getting a visa for Vietnam might require that you have additional passport photos -- you may want to have those printed ahead of time.  Another thing to keep in mind is that some countries require proof of an onward ticket -- if you don't have one, airlines may refuse to allow you to board, so check into this in order make sure you are prepared before arriving at the aiport and don't have to hastily book a ticket. 


### What to Bring

This varies quite a bit. I am not a carry-on only packer -- for me, the stress vs benefits aren't really there. Lighter is better, but you do want to make sure you have the stuff you need. Often, you don't need to bring a huge amount of clothes, but the clothing or shoes sizes you wear are not easy to find in the locations you are considering visiting, make sure to bring enough of those items in case you can't obtain them easily locally. Make sure to bring medications ahead of time -- I would recommend bringing some sort of pain relief pills as well as digestive medicines so you have them ahead of time -- and fill any necessary prescriptions before you leave. In addition to your computer, phone, and charger, you may want to consider a set of noise-cancelling headphones, and I would definitely suggest you bring some external battery packs that could be used to charge your devices on the go. 

Additionally, before arriving in the country you may want to do some preparation and download apps or information to make your life easier, such as offline maps, translations for languages that are spoken in the locations you've been travelling to, and apps for the local rideshare services. 


Planning your first trip as a digital nomad can be exhausting and maybe overwhelming, but it's totally worth it. When considering destinations, you'll need to keep in mind your absolutely necessary requirements for getting work done and balance those with your personal preferences and needs. Make sure to research how safe a given location is. Once you have an idea of that, I would suggest looking into how accessible the Internet is in terms of speed and reliability in that area. Then I would dive more into specifics, such as what I might be interested in seeing while there, where I might want to live, figuring out for how long I might want to stay there, and if there are other nearby destinations that are appealing to visit afterwards. Don't overthink everything and let it derail your trip, but keeping these things in mind will definitely help make your digital nomad journey successful.
