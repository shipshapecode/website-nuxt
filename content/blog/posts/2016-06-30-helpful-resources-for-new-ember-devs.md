title: Helpful Resources for New Ember Devs
---

I have noticed a lot of developers start trying to pick up Ember, and they get overwhelmed by the steep learning curve and the inability to find up to date and helpful resources for learning about Ember, finding addons, how to do things the Ember way, etc.

In order to try to ease some of this pain, I am going to try to list some various resources here that may be of help.

#### Documentation
1. [Ember.js Official Docs](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/)

#### Examples/Blogs
1. [DockYard Blog](https://dockyard.com/blog)

#### Finding Addons
1. [Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/)
2. [Ember Addons](https://www.emberaddons.com/)

#### Podcasts
1. [Ember Weekend](https://emberweekend.com/episodes)
2. [Ember Land](http://ember.land/)

#### Tutorials
1. [YoEmber](http://yoember.com/)

This list is by no means exhaustive, but should be enough to help get you going.
