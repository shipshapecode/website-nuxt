# Preface

Don't rock the boat, a mentor of mine once suggest don't make or suggest any major changes in the first three months.

This does not mean though that you cant enable small suggestions such as enabling new lint rules, though keep in mind if there
are a ton of small changes these MR's should have the rule set to warn and many small merge requests here are better for the sake of the pull/merge request viewer.

- meetings should have purpose incase they can be addressed ahead of time

- No CI or not well thought out ones
- No E2E testing in CI or overlaping or tests that should be split
- No CD or automated deployment
- Precommit rules not set
- Not enforcing node version
- Flakey tests that should be skipped or revaluated.
