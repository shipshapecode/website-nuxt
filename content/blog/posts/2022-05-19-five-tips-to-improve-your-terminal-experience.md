title: 5 Tips to Improve Your Terminal Experience
---

Working in software, we know the stereotypical terminals shown in movie scenes - with green text 
whizzing through black backgrounds as a hacker furiously slings commands from memory onto an eight 
inch screen - is far from the reality of today's development.

While our day-to-day development process might not appear as exciting and action-packed as the silver 
screen renditions, as software developers, we do have a lot of great options to streamline our workflows 
by improving the style and functionality of our terminals.

# Fish

One of the biggest improvements to my experience in the terminal was from switching from `bash` to
[fish](https://fishshell.com/). Fish upgrades your terminal with features like autosuggestions, that
remember commands you have run before and try to auto complete them for you, and automatically
generates auto completes for other utilities by parsing their man pages, neat!

# Starship

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) is a cross-shell prompt that is blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable.
It is built in Rust, which gives it best-in-class speed and safety, to make your prompt as quick and reliable
as possible. Out of the box it shows you pertinent information like what git branch you are on, what version of CLI 
tools you are running (e.g. node, Rust, etc), how long commands took to run, and so much more!

# MonoLisa

Yes, this font costs money, and yes it is worth spending money on. There are a lot of nice free fonts
out there, and I personally used [Input](https://input.djr.com/) before, but there is just something special about [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/)
that cannot be put into words. It just feels clean and extremely legible. Their website says it was designed "to improve developers' productivity and reduce fatigue"
and I think they nailed it!

# Hyper

The built in terminal on Mac is decent, and has been getting some updates, but it tends to lag
behind alternatives in terms of features. [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) is another popular option, and new players to the space
like [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) promise all kinds of new and exciting features.

However, my current gold standard for terminals is [Hyper](https://hyper.is/). I have been using it for many years
and it was built by the folks at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), who you may have heard of.

# asdf

If you have worked on multiple different projects, throughout your career, odds are you have encountered a
need to switch `node`, `ruby`, etc. versions depending on the project. There are several independent tools that
exist for managing versions of these tools like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [rvm](https://rvm.io/)
but I have recently been opting more for an all-in-one solution [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).

`asdf` supports auto switching versions of tools as you change directories in your terminal, so if you
create a `.tool-versions` file and specify the versions there, you can magically use the correct
versions for every project, as soon as you `cd` into that directory! ðŸŽ‰
