          They helped our small team build a product from the ground up
          and were strong partners every step of the way. Their domain expertise
          in Next.js and React helped lay the foundation for a scalable codebase,
          and they were great at ensuring we adhered to engineering best practices.
          Every member of the team was a pleasure to work with and (best of all)
          we ended up launching our MVP on schedule!`

        best practices to keep our code base current, and they were able to
        deliver on critical features on our roadmap that we did not have the
        bandwidth to complete on time. I would absolutely recommend Ship Shape
        to any other business that is looking for an incredibly skilled
        partner to work closely with their teams to produce and deliver the
        highest value.`

          we had never even thought of or knew about. Our team learned a huge
          amount of new information and new tricks, and we still have them on
          retainer for very specific questions. Plus, Ship Shape is the
          friendliest team of engineers I've worked with.`
