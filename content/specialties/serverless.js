It’s a model that offloads server management to a third party, only charges you for actual usage, and makes it easy to auto-scale as demand increases. \n \n Why pay for computing power you aren’t using? With serverless frameworks, high server costs are a thing of the past.',

  quote: `I loved working with Ship Shape. 
          They helped our small team build a product from the ground up 
          and were strong partners every step of the way. Their domain expertise 
          in Next.js and React helped lay the foundation for a scalable codebase, 
          and they were great at ensuring we adhered to engineering best practices. 
          Every member of the team was a pleasure to work with and (best of all) 
          we ended up launching our MVP on schedule!`
