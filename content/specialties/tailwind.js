  quote: `I loved working with Ship Shape.
          They helped our small team build a product from the ground up
          and were strong partners every step of the way. Their domain expertise
          in Next.js and React helped lay the foundation for a scalable codebase,
          and they were great at ensuring we adhered to engineering best practices.
          Every member of the team was a pleasure to work with and (best of all)
          we ended up launching our MVP on schedule!`
